## 🎯 Profile System Overview

The Unified QueryRAG Engine uses a **profile-agnostic architecture** that allows you to work with different datasets without changing any code. Each profile is completely self-contained and includes:

- **Data schema definitions**
- **Cleaning and preprocessing rules**
- **LLM provider configurations**
- **Document templates**
- **Test data and configurations**

### Profile Structure

Each profile is organized in a dedicated directory with the following structure:

- **`profile_config.py`**: Main configuration with data schema, cleaning rules, and LLM settings
- **`config_api_keys.py`**: API keys and provider configurations  
- **`test_data/`**: Sample data files for testing
- **`tests/`**: Test configurations and validation scripts

This modular approach allows you to easily switch between different datasets and configurations without changing any core code.

## 🧪 Testing

> **🎯 Goal:** Verify everything works perfectly before moving to production!

### 🚀 Quick Test (30 seconds)
Want to see if everything is working? Run this quick test:

```bash

from ..base_profile import BaseProfile, ColumnDefinition, SensitizationRule

class YourProfile(BaseProfile):
    """Your custom profile configuration."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.profile_name = "your_profile_name"
        self.language = "en-US"
        self.locale = "en_US"
        
    def get_data_file_path(self) -> str:
        return str(self.get_test_data_path() / "your_data.csv")
    
    def get_required_columns(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["ID", "NAME", "VALUE", "DATE"]
    
    def get_sensitive_columns(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["ID"]
    
    def get_text_columns(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["NAME", "DESCRIPTION"]
    
    def clean_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        # Your custom cleaning logic
        return df
```

#### 3. Create API Keys Configuration

```bash
# Create tests directory
mkdir -p config/profiles/your_profile_name/tests

# Copy test templates
cp config/profiles/default_profile/tests/test_*.py config/profiles/your_profile_name/tests/
```

### Profile Switching

Switching between profiles is straightforward and follows this process:

1. **Update Configuration**: Change the profile name in `config/settings.py`
2. **Profile Loading**: The system automatically loads the new profile configuration
3. **Data Loading**: New data and schema are loaded from the profile directory
4. **Engine Update**: The unified engine is updated with the new configuration
5. **Ready State**: The system is ready to handle queries with the new profile

This process ensures seamless switching between different datasets and configurations without code changes.

#### Switch Profiles
```python
# In config/settings.py
PROFILE = "your_profile_name"  # Change this line

# Restart the server
python scripts/run_unified_api.py

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

> **🆘 Having issues?** Don't worry! Here are solutions to the most common problems.

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. 📦 Import Errors
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError` or import issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/ultra_plus_queryRagMcp

# Check Python path
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.11+
```

#### 2. 🔑 API Key Issues
**Problem:** `API key not found` or authentication errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify API keys are set
python -c "from config.profiles.default_profile.config_api_keys import *; print('API keys loaded')"

# Check if the file exists
ls -la config/profiles/default_profile/config_api_keys.py
```

#### 3. 🧪 Test Failures
**Problem:** Tests are failing or data issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check test data
python config/profiles/default_profile/tests/setup_test_data.py verify

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest config/profiles/default_profile/tests/ -v -s

# Check if data files exist
ls -la config/profiles/default_profile/test_data/
```

#### 4. 🖥️ Server Issues
**Problem:** Server won't start or port conflicts

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if port is available
netstat -tulpn | grep :8000

# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f "uvicorn api.unified_api:app"

# Check logs for errors
tail -f logs/app.log
tail -f logs/error.log
```

#### 5. 🐛 Vector Store Issues
**Problem:** `Collection does not exist` or vector store errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete and rebuild vector store
rm -rf storage/vector_store/*

# Restart the server (it will rebuild automatically)
python scripts/run_unified_api.py
```

### 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the logs:** `tail -f logs/app.log`
2. **Verify your Python version:** `python --version`
3. **Check API keys:** Make sure they're valid and active
4. **Restart everything:** Kill all processes and start fresh
5. **Check disk space:** Ensure you have enough free space

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Most issues are resolved by restarting the server and rebuilding the vector store!

### Performance Tuning

#### 1. Memory Optimization
```python
# In profile configuration
def get_sample_size(self) -> int:
    return 1000  # Limit data size for testing
```

#### 2. Response Time Optimization
```python
# In settings
CHUNK_SIZE = 500  # Smaller chunks for faster processing
TOP_K = 10  # Limit search results
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Checks
```bash
# API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# MCP health
curl http://localhost:7800/health
```

### Logging
```bash
# View logs
tail -f logs/unified_engine.log
tail -f logs/api.log
tail -f logs/mcp.log
```

### Metrics
```bash
# Get statistics
